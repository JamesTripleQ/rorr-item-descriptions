# rorr-item-descriptions
A primitive text mod that replaces the pickup text with the detailed description from the logbook.

## How to install
- download the mod by clicking the green "<> Code" button (or by [clicking this link](https://github.com/SeymourSchlong/rorr-item-descriptions/archive/refs/heads/main.zip))
- hit the "Download Zip" button
- browse Risk of Rain Returns' local files
- open the `language` folder   (folder directory: `Steam\steamapps\common\Risk of Rain Returns\language`)
- simply add the `descriptions` folder with all the other languages

that is it!

once you've done that, open the game and click the language icon in the top-right to switch to item descriptions!
